Word Guess Game (Challenge - Recommended)

    Choose a theme for your game! You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!

    Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

    Display the following on the page:

        Press any key to get started!

        Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

        If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.

        As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _ _ a.

        Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

        Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).

    After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.



I modified some of the requirments to fit the overall theme of my game.

    Instead of tallying wins, the player goes up in experience levels.

    Instead of tallying losses, the player starts with 10 health and each failed array takes 1 health point away.

    After the tenth fail the game is over, the player can refresh there browser and try again, there is a death screen

    Each wrong guess increases the opacity of the monsters image, like it's coming out of the dungeon at the player.

    Each correct guess also increases the opacity, just not as much.



The game uses elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
